        Leslie Barbara Knope is a fictional character and the main protagonist
        of the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation. She is portrayed by former SNL
        cast member Amy Poehler. For most of the show's run, she serves as
        Deputy Director of the Parks and Recreation Department of the fictional
        city of Pawnee, Indiana. An over-achiever, Knope believes the government
        should serve the people. The character has evolved greatly over the
        seasons, initially portrayed by Poehler as an exaggerated scatterbrain
        before gradually shifting to a more subtle performance. Poehler's
        performance as Knope has been nominated for several awards, winning a
        2014 Golden Globe.

        Knope was born on January 18, 1975 (S4: E3) in Eagleton, Indiana due to
        a raccoon infestation in Pawnee, and has lived in Pawnee, Indiana since
        infancy. According to the show's timeline, her father died in 1985 (S5:
        E14). She was inspired to pursue a life of public service by the
        community programs she enjoyed as a child. While attending Pawnee North
        High School she served as Co-Vice President of the student body and
        participated in several student organizations including the Model United
        Nations, Debate Club, Mock Trial, Young Republicans, Young Democrats and
        Young Independents, which she founded. She graduated in the top five
        percent of her high school class and summa cum laude from Indiana
        University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA). In the
        first three seasons, Leslie is the Deputy in Pawnee's Parks and
        Recreation Department, a mid-level bureaucratic position;[3] in season
        4, she successfully campaigns to become a member of the city council. In
        her role as Deputy Director she serves on several committees, including
        the Equal Opportunity Committee, the Fun in the Sun Committee, the Clean
        Restroom Task Force, the Handicapped Restroom Task Force, and the Task
        Force to Reduce the Number of Public Restrooms. She hopes to improve her
        town and to advance her career (possibly aiming to become the City
        Manager). She has also stated her ultimate goal of becoming the first
        female President of the United States. Knope proudly displays in her
        office images of Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Madeleine Albright,
        Condoleezza Rice, Dianne Feinstein, Janet Reno, Nancy Pelosi, and Larry
        Bird. Leslie also has a love for sweets, especially waffles (which she
        frequently orders in large quantities at J.J.'s Diner) and whipped
        cream, which she puts on coffee, waffles, etc.
